in orther to do some analysis on data sometime you need to convert your data from a xlsx or csv file to a json file that contain some logs , so for that I decide to build a convertor of an excel files (.xlsx) to json file (logs), I do a test on a world cup data and you can see the output in the json file path .

paths : 

source code : src/main/java

json files : /jsonFiles

raw data : /files

all dependencies needed on this code are in the pom.xml file
