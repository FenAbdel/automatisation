# Whatsapp message automatisation

I had a mission to contact +10 peaple in order to inform them with the same information so I think to automate the thing instead of doing it manually .

I use 4 librarys in my code to do it : pyautogui,pyperclip,webbrowser,time

to install the libs : 

* pip install pyperclip
* pip install pyautogui

time and webbrowser are part of the python standard library, you don't have to install a separate package to use it because it comes bundled with your python installation.

pyperclips a cross-platform Python module for copy and paste clipboard functions. It works with Python 2 and 3.<br>
pyautogui lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. 

first your browser should be connected to whatsapp web to accomplish the thing.

in the numberslist dictionnaire you should enter the number of the pple you want to contact in the format of "key":"value"

the key is their name and if you don't have names just index it like 1,2,3.. and the value is their number 

then write you message in the text variable ,and all you need to do is to press run XD
